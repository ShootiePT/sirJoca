# Sir Joca

We participated in CodeForAll's GameJam during week 6 of the Full-Stack programming bootcamp. Throughout this event, we delved into concepts such as SimpleGraphics, I/O, animations, GitHub workflow, compiling libraries and resources, map and level design, and optimization. Additionally, the GameJam provided an excellent opportunity to practice pair programming and understand the entire process of creating a digital game, from idea conception to production and the first release.

## Introduction

SirJoca was a project carried out with the intention of showcasing what was learned over 6 weeks in the bootcamp. We had to create a game in one week. We opted for a platformer game because we are lovers of this type of games.

## Features

You can walk, run, jump, and kill some enemies by jumping on top of them. It's possible to collect suns (with the face of one of the bootcamp trainers). The player has 3 lives before game over, and when losing a life (heart), they become invulnerable for a short period of time.

## Installation

To access the test level in hard mode, please follow this link: [Sir Joca: A Tale of a Slime Slayer - Test Level](https://danielcar1992.itch.io/sir-joca-a-tale-of-a-slime-slayer)

**Note:** This requires the latest version of Java installed on your system. Launch the .jar file using the console/command line.


## Contributing

Feel free to suggest ideas for improving the project. Please note that we used the SimpleGraphics library, and in the future, if we revisit SirJoca, we intend to use another library.
