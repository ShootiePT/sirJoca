We participated in CodeForAll's GameJam during week 6 of the Full-Stack programming bootcamp. Throughout this event, we delved into concepts such as SimpleGraphics, I/O, animations, GitHub workflow, compiling libraries and resources, map and level design, and optimization. Additionally, the GameJam provided an excellent opportunity to practice pair programming and understand the entire process of creating a digital game, from idea conception to production and the first release.
